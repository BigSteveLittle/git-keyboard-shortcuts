# GIT Keyboard Shortcuts

A listing of Git command-line keyboard shortcuts in Excel and OpenOffice format.

I am a beginner with GIT. So any GIT experts are encouraged to examine and offer changes. These shortcuts come after I went through just about every course on **LinkedIn Learning**. These course are a little out of date as some only mentioned 'checkout' or 'diff' and not 'switch' or 'show'.
