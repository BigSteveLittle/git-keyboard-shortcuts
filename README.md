# GIT Command-Line Commands

A listing of Git command-line commands in Excel and OpenOffice format.

I am a beginner with GIT. So any GIT experts are encouraged to examine and offer changes. These shortcuts come after I went through just about every course on **LinkedIn Learning** about Git. Many of these courses are a little out of date. For example some only mention 'checkout' or 'diff' and not the newer commands such as 'switch' or 'show'. However from the few courses that *were* up to date I have aimed to make this list as up to date as possible.
